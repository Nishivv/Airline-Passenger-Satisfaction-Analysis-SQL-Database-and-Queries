# ✈️ Airline Passenger Satisfaction Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview

This SQL project explores **Airline Passenger Satisfaction** by analyzing customer feedback and flight-related operational data. The dataset includes variables such as customer type, travel class, service ratings (e.g., seat comfort, inflight entertainment), flight delays, and overall satisfaction.

The goal is to extract meaningful insights into factors affecting passenger satisfaction, service performance, and operational challenges using SQL queries.
